# Murder in SQL City üîç  

This project is based on the [SQL Murder Mystery dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnp47/sql-murder-mystery-database/data).  
It gave me the opportunity to practice and demonstrate my **SQL querying skills** in a fun and interactive way.  

## Project Overview  
- The goal of the project is to solve a fictional **murder case** using SQL queries.  
- I worked in the **Kaggle Notebook environment**, where I combined Python with SQL.  
- To keep the project **SQL-focused**, I used **IPython SQL Magic Functions** so that most of the logic is expressed directly in SQL rather than Python.  

## Why SQL Magic?  
Although a purely Pythonic solution (e.g., using pandas or SQLAlchemy) would be more generalizable, in this project I wanted to:  
- Practice **writing raw SQL queries**.  
- Show familiarity with **joins, filtering, grouping, and subqueries**.  
- Highlight how SQL can be used as a powerful tool for **data exploration and investigation**.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Writing and optimizing SQL queries  
- Combining SQL with Python environments (via Magic Commands)  
- Working with relational data and applying logical reasoning to reach conclusions  

## Notes  
I have other projects that focus more on Python and data analysis techniques. Here, the main goal was to practice and present my **SQL abilities** through an applied example.
